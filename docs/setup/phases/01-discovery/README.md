# Phase 1: Discovery

## Overview

The Discovery phase focuses on understanding the problem space, gathering requirements, and validating the product concept before committing to development.

## Objectives

- Define clear problem statement
- Identify stakeholders and users
- Gather and prioritize requirements
- Conduct competitive analysis
- Validate assumptions with research

## Duration

Typical: 1-2 weeks (scale based on project complexity)

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Problem Statement Document
- Clear articulation of the problem
- Impact and scope definition
- Success metrics

### 2. Stakeholder Analysis
Template: [stakeholder-analysis.md](./stakeholder-analysis.md)
- All stakeholders identified
- Influence and interest mapped
- Communication plan defined

### 3. Requirements Document
Template: [requirements-template.md](./requirements-template.md)
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Constraints and assumptions

### 4. User Stories
Template: [user-story-template.md](./user-story-template.md)
- As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]
- Acceptance criteria for each story

## AI Collaboration Tips

### Effective Prompts

```
"Help me define the problem statement for [project].
Consider: Who is affected? What is the impact?
What happens if we don't solve this?"
```

```
"Analyze these requirements and identify:
1. Missing edge cases
2. Potential conflicts
3. Unclear acceptance criteria"
```

```
"Generate user stories for [feature] covering:
- Primary user flow
- Error scenarios
- Edge cases"
```

```
"Create a stakeholder analysis for a [type] project.
Include: influence level, interest level, communication needs"
```

```
