# Phase 2: Planning

## Overview

The Planning phase translates requirements into a concrete implementation plan, including architecture design, task breakdown, and risk assessment.

## Objectives

- Design system architecture
- Select technologies
- Break down work into tasks
- Identify and mitigate risks
- Document architectural decisions

## Duration

Typical: 1-2 weeks (scale based on project complexity)

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Architecture Design Document
Template: [architecture-template.md](./architecture-template.md)
- System overview
- Component design
- Data model
- API contracts

### 2. Task Breakdown
Template: [task-breakdown.md](./task-breakdown.md)
- Feature decomposition
- Task dependencies
- Priority assignment

### 3. Risk Assessment
Template: [risk-assessment.md](./risk-assessment.md)
- Technical risks
- Mitigation strategies
- Contingency plans

### 4. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
Template: [../../templates/adr-template.md](../../templates/adr-template.md)
- Technology choices
- Design patterns
- Trade-off analysis

## Process

### Step 1: Architecture Design

1. Review requirements from Discovery
2. Identify system components
3. Design component interactions
4. Define data model
5. Specify API contracts

**Output**: Architecture design document

### Step 2: Technology Selection

1. Evaluate technology options
2. Consider team expertise
3. Assess scalability needs
4. Document decisions in ADRs

**Output**: Technology stack decision with ADRs

### Step 3: Task Breakdown

1. Decompose features into tasks
2. Identify dependencies
3. Estimate effort
4. Assign priorities

**Output**: Task backlog

### Step 4: Risk Assessment

1. Identify technical risks
2. Assess impact and probability
3. Define mitigation strategies
4. Create contingency plans

**Output**: Risk register

### Step 5: Planning Review

1. Review with stakeholders
2. Validate feasibility
3. Adjust based on feedback
4. Get sign-off

**Output**: Approved plan

## AI Collaboration Tips

### Effective Prompts

```
"Design the architecture for [feature/system] with these requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
Consider: scalability, security, maintainability"
```

```
"Break down [feature] into implementation tasks.
Include: task description, dependencies, estimated complexity"
```

```
"What risks should we consider for [approach/technology]?
Include: technical risks, mitigation strategies"
```

```
"Create an ADR for choosing [option A] over [option B] for [requirement].
Include: context, decision, consequences"
```

```
"Evaluate [technology A] vs [technology B] for [use case].
Consider: performance, team expertise, community support, cost"
```

```
"Define the API contract for [feature].
Include: endpoints, request/response formats, error handling"
```
