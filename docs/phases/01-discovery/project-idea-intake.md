# Project Idea Intake

Use this document to capture your initial project idea. Don't worry about structure or completeness - just get your thoughts down. Claude will help refine and structure this during the discovery phase.

---

## The Idea

*Describe what you want to build in your own words. Be as detailed or rough as you like.*

```
[Your idea here - write freely, bullet points, paragraphs, whatever works]





```

---

## Problem / Opportunity

*What problem does this solve? Or what opportunity does it address?*

```
[Why does this need to exist?]



```

---

## Users

*Who will use this? List anyone you can think of.*

```
[e.g., "small business owners", "our internal team", "developers who need X"]



```

---

## Key Features (Brain Dump)

*List features, capabilities, or things users should be able to do. Don't filter - just dump everything.*

```

---

## Inspirations / References

*Are there similar products? Screenshots? Competitors? Things you like or don't like?*

```
[Links, names, or descriptions of things that inspire this idea]



```

---

## Technical Thoughts (Optional)

*Any technical ideas, constraints, or preferences you already have in mind.*

```
[e.g., "needs to work offline", "must integrate with Slack", "real-time updates important"]



```

---

## What Success Looks Like

*How would you know this project succeeded?*

```
[e.g., "users can do X in under 5 minutes", "replaces our current spreadsheet", "100 daily active users"]



```

---

## Open Questions

*Things you're unsure about or need to figure out.*

```

```

---

## Priority / Timeline

*Any constraints on when this needs to ship or what's most important?*

```
[e.g., "MVP in 2 months", "core feature X must work first", "demo for investors in January"]



```

# What Happens Next

Once you've filled this out (even partially), use `/start-discovery` and share this document. Claude will:

1. **Extract and organize** your ideas into structured requirements
2. **Identify gaps** and ask clarifying questions
3. **Generate** user stories, stakeholder analysis, and a requirements document
4. **Suggest** a path forward into the planning phase

You don't need to fill out every section - write what you know, and the discovery process will help fill in the rest.
