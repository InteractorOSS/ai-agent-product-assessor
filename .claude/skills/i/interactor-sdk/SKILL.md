# Interactor SDK Examples Skill

**Documentation:** `docs/i/interactor-docs/integration-guide/07-sdk-examples.md`

## When to Use

- Building new applications that need Interactor integration
- Need complete, reusable client classes for Interactor APIs
- Implementing secure webhook receivers with signature verification
- Building SSE-based real-time features for AI agents or workflows
- Reference implementation for error handling, retries, and token management

## Prerequisites

- Interactor authentication configured (see `interactor-auth` skill)
- TypeScript: Node.js 18+ with `axios` dependency
- Python: Python 3.9+ with `httpx` or `requests`

## Instructions

Read the full documentation at the source path above for:
- Complete TypeScript/Node.js client implementation
- Complete Python (sync and async) client implementation
- Webhook handler with signature verification
- SSE streaming components for real-time features
